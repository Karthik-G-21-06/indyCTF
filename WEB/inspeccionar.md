## how I did it
Firstly I deployed the website which comes up as shown below

<img src="/picture/inspecci.png" style="height: 500px; width:500px;"/>


Now right click and click inspect. Inside inspector click on the three dot near class='main' and click on the second p in and click on three dots near blur. now on your right you could see filter styles inside which we have pseudo-elements where the flag is given in content
