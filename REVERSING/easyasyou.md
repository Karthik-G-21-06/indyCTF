# How I did it

since it is a binary file just used stings and to find out wheather it has any strings. and found that there is some string starting with ictf{. now just scrolled through the whole sting list and found a flag. but was not the flag. Now I simply gave the password after running the file and got the file

## Flag

Tha flag is: ```ictf{Th1s_w4s_n0t_s0_d1ff1cul7}```
